Welcome to FungToxins, a database for fungal toxins.<br>
FungToxins contains manually annotated experimental data on the toxic action of fungal metabolites and the species that produce them.<br>
Biosynthetic information of these compounds is provided based on biosynthetic gene clusters in [the MIBiG database](https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/){:target="_blank"}.<br>
FungToxins also collects data from authorities ([EFSA](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en){:target="_blank"}, [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/){:target="_blank"}) on regulation of mycotoxins in food and information on the carcinogenicity of compounds provided by the [IARC](https://monographs.iarc.who.int/){:target="_blank"}.<br>
<br>
You can find an overview of all compounds [here](overview.md).<br>
